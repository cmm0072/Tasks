#'Why do we see a range of loci shared? This is a good thing to understand. So, when sexual reproduction take place, 50% of the passed down loci are from one parent and the other 50% come from the other parent. However, the 50% that is passed down from each parent is completely random. So, theorectically (practically not going to happen) you can have NO loci shared between 2 siblings. If the 50% of the two parents don't overlap with what is passed down to each sibling respectively in each parent. I hope this answered the question, I understand the concept and don't want to get too much into the nitty gritty details. Just the 50% from each parent is random so the offspring will represent this randomness.'
