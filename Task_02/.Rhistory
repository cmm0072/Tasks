#'Upon further research, it seems that length () gives the number of colums and nrow () the number of rows, which makes more sense.'
#'From the swirl lessons. I think the way they explained the difference is that a matrix is like a 2 dimensional vector. The length of a vector would be the columns and then if you add rows to it, you get a matrix'
#'Referring to my swirl lesson notes, the which () function is used to determine what parts of a vector return as true. I understand the theory of which () but as for applying in the two exmaples, I would need that to be explained to me.'
#'I looked through my swirl notes and I came across this 'x[!is.na(x)]' and it says that it gives all the non NA things in a vector. So, I think I could use this in order to see how many different numbers were in the list. Then if you didnt want to count, could you do sum (x[!is.na(x)]) ?'
